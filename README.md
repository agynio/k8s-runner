# k8s-runner

k8s-runner is the Kubernetes-native implementation of the RunnerService gRPC API.

Architecture: [k8s-runner](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/k8s-runner.md)

## Local Development

Full setup: [Local Development](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/operations/local-development.md)

### Prepare environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agynio/bootstrap.git
cd bootstrap
chmod +x apply.sh
./apply.sh -y
```

See [bootstrap](https://github.com/agynio/bootstrap) for details.

### Run from sources

```bash
# Deploy once (exit when healthy)
devspace dev

# Watch mode (streams logs, re-syncs on changes)
devspace dev -w
```

### Run tests

```bash
devspace run test:e2e
```

See [E2E Testing](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/operations/e2e-testing.md).

## Docker capability notes

The `docker` capability injects a Docker sidecar. For the **rootless**
implementation, the sidecar runs nested `runc` and requires additional
permissions and mounts to allow `docker run` to work:

- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` for rootlesskit/newuidmap.
- `seccompProfile: Unconfined` and `appArmorProfile: Unconfined` because
  default RuntimeDefault/AppArmor profiles block mount-related syscalls
  (for example mounting `/proc`) required by nested `runc`.
- `procMount: Unmasked` to avoid `/proc` mount masking interfering with
  nested `runc` container setup.
- HostPath mount for `/dev/net/tun` (type `CharDevice`).
- `docker-data` emptyDir mounted at `/home/rootless/.local/share` so dockerd
  can create its own `docker/` data root with correct ownership.

These settings can require Pod Security Admission exceptions for docker-capable
workloads (baseline/restricted clusters may reject them).
