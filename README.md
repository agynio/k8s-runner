# k8s-runner

k8s-runner is the Kubernetes-native implementation of the RunnerService gRPC API.

Architecture: [k8s-runner](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/k8s-runner.md)

## Local Development

Full setup: [Local Development](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/operations/local-development.md)

### Prepare environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agynio/bootstrap.git
cd bootstrap
chmod +x apply.sh
./apply.sh -y
```

See [bootstrap](https://github.com/agynio/bootstrap) for details.

### Run from sources

```bash
# Deploy once (exit when healthy)
devspace dev

# Watch mode (streams logs, re-syncs on changes)
devspace dev -w
```

### E2E tests

E2E coverage runs from the centralized suite in
[`agynio/e2e`](https://github.com/agynio/e2e) using the `k8s_runner` service tag.
See [E2E Testing](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/operations/e2e-testing.md).

## Docker capability notes

The `docker` capability injects a Docker sidecar. For the **rootless**
implementation, the sidecar runs nested `runc` and requires additional
permissions and mounts to allow `docker run` to work:

- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` for rootlesskit/newuidmap.
- `seccompProfile: Unconfined` and `appArmorProfile: Unconfined` because
  default RuntimeDefault/AppArmor profiles block mount-related syscalls
  (for example mounting `/proc`) required by nested `runc`.
- `procMount: Unmasked` to avoid `/proc` mount masking interfering with
  nested `runc` container setup.
- `pod.spec.hostUsers: false` with an init container that writes
  `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` entries inside the pod user namespace.
- HostPath mount for `/dev/net/tun` (type `CharDevice`).
- `docker-data` emptyDir mounted at `/home/rootless/.local/share` so dockerd
  can create its own `docker/` data root with correct ownership.

These settings can require Pod Security Admission exceptions for docker-capable
workloads (baseline/restricted clusters may reject them).

### Kata (microVM) docker runtimes

`CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATIONS` also supports `docker: kata-qemu` (and optionally
`docker: kata-fc`). When enabled, k8s-runner keeps the privileged DinD sidecar
behavior but sets `pod.spec.runtimeClassName` to match the selected Kata
implementation. The cluster must provide the matching RuntimeClass and schedule
onto KVM-capable nodes. This cannot be validated on local k3d/mac setups.
